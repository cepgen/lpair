 To build this version of LPAIR :

 * First of all ensure that you have a working instance of
   CERNLIB installed on your computer with PDFLIB.
   If not, go on 

   http://www-zeuthen.desy.de/linear_collider/cernlib/new/

   and fetch one of the provided versions (the last one 
   was released in 2006).

 * Compile LPAIR (ilpair-cms-pp.f) and its dependencies
   (located in source/) :

   	 make

 * Once the compilation has been done, edit the configuration
   file lpair.card to set the requested the process and kinematics.

   See http://www.desy.de/~heramc/programs/lpair/lpair.pdf
   for the complete list of parameters to be provided.
   Run LPAIR by typing 

         ./lpair <path to any lpair.card>

   where the argument is facultative (if no argument is provided
   the program will look for any default card named lpair.card in
   the current directory).
